At points, I have taken code from that analysis. However, it was not directly copied. I used it as a way to learn, played with each feature to ensure I understand what I did before implimenting it. 
I am new to utilising python for cleaning and analysis so attempting myself while having a notebook to look at and use as a guide was very helpful and aided my understanding greatly.
