As part of a data analytics with python course, I was tasked with tasked with sourcing a dataset


This dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/code/ronaldonyango/suicide-rates-analysis. That link also has a notebook that provides various analysis. 
At points, I have taken code from that analysis. However, it was not directly copied. I used it as a way to learn, played with each feature to ensure I understand what I did before implimenting it. 
I am new to utilising python for cleaning and analysis so attempting myself while having a notebook to look at and use as a guide was very helpful and aided my understanding greatly.

This is a practise run at data cleaning and visualisation for suicide rates over population, gender, age and various other factors.
Comments throughout are my thoughts and points where I've had to learn along with some analysis.
