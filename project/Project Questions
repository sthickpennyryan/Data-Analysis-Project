'''Questions posed at the beginning'''
'''Is there a correlation between suicide rates and GDP per capita?
-There is a correlation of 0.0063 between suicide rates per 100k and the GDP per capita. As this is very close to 0, the correlation is very weak, 
if at all there.'''
'Is there a correlation between suicide rates and GDP per capita?\n-There is a correlation of 0.0063 between suicide rates per 100k and the GDP per capita. As this is very close to 0, the correlation is very weak, \nif at all there.'
#How does the suicide rate change over time within different age groups?
suicides_by_generation = df.groupby(['AgeGroup', 'Year'])['SuicideCount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
suicide_rate = df.groupby(['AgeGroup', 'Year'])['DeathRatePer100K'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()


'''
[0] shows consistant suicide rages for agegroups, other than in the 35-54 where they peak more rapidly than other groups. However, the downward
incline at the end may be representative of incomplete data. 

[1] shows a decrease in suicides per 100k in all age groups until around 2020 where there is a slight increase.
Could add in gender to see if the trend continues but overall it does show that while the suicide total per year is somewhere consistant
across age groups. The death by suicide in general population is decreasing, suggesting stagnation of suicide rates while population increases across 
all age groups.

#the heat map shows a -0.07 correlation between suicides per 100k and employmentpopulation ratio. Suggestings a weak negative correlation.
#Meaning that as that ratio of employement increases, suicide decreases, slightly. 
#i want to change this to a barchart correlation



#understanding the data.
''' Weak to no relationship between Gross national, GDP, GDP per capita, GNI Per Capita as they sit around 0.
Or slightly above/below.
Two factors show a stronger relationship than other factors, however, weak in terms of correlation.
Inflation rate is around 0.05 suggesting, if at all, a weak relationship between higher inflation rates 
and suicide rates.
The strongest negative correlation comes ata Employment ratio vs Suicide Rates. Suggesting a weak relationship
between higher employment rates and lower suicide rates and it's converse. 

The direction of these correlations, while expected are too low to identify any relationship and therefore it
cannot be concluded that there are any strong or negative relationships between the factors listed below and
their effect on suicide rates.
