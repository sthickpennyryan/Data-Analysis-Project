Project Questions:
1) Is there a correlation between suicide rates and GDP per capita or gross national income per capita?
2) How does the suicide rate compare across age groups? 
3) What is the relationship between suicide rates and specific age groups or generations?
4) How does the employment population ratio correlate with suicide rates?

-----------------------------------------------
1) Is there a correlation between suicide rates and GDP per capita?
-There is a correlation of 0.0063 between suicide rates per 100k and the GDP per capita. As this is very close to 0, the correlation is very weak and not sigificant, 
if at all there.

Is there a correlation between suicide rates and GDP per capita?
  There is a correlation of 0.0063 between suicide rates per 100k and the GDP per capita. As this is very close to 0, the correlation is very weak, \nif at all there.'


-----------------------------------------------
2) How does the suicide rate compare across age groups? 
  Code for Bar Chart comparing suicide rates:
                    suicides_by_generation = df.groupby(['AgeGroup', 'Year'])['SuicideCount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
                    suicide_rate = df.groupby(['AgeGroup', 'Year'])['DeathRatePer100K'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
                    
                    fig,ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(16,6))
                    
                    sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='SuicideCount', 
                                data=suicides_by_generation, 
                                ax=ax[0], 
                                hue='AgeGroup')
                    ax[0].set_title('Suicide amounts by age Group')
                    ax[0].set_ylabel('Suicide Totals per Year')
                    
                    
                    sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='DeathRatePer100K', 
                                data=suicide_rate, ax=ax[1],
                                hue='AgeGroup')
                    ax[1].set_title('Deaths by suicide per 100k over age groups')
                    ax[1].set_ylabel('Suicides per 100k')


[0] Shows consistant suicide rages for agegroups, other than in the 35-54 where they peak more rapidly than other groups. However, the downward
incline at the end may be representative of incomplete data. 

[1] shows a decrease in suicides per 100k in all age groups until around 2020 where there is a slight increase.
The death by suicide in general population is decreasing, suggesting stagnation of suicide rates while population increases across 
all age groups.

3) What is the relationship between suicide rates and specific age groups or generations?

      Code: Comparing total suicides per generation vs suicides per 100000 populus.

                      suicides_by_generation = df.groupby(['Generation', 'Sex'])['SuicideCount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
                      suicide_rate = df.groupby(['Generation', 'Sex'])['DeathRatePer100K'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index()
                      
                      fig,ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(24,8))
                                
                      sns.barplot(x='Generation', y='SuicideCount', 
                      data=suicides_by_generation, ax=ax[0], 
                      edgecolor='black', errorbar=None
                                 )
                      ax[0].set_title('Total Suicides organised by Generation')
                      ax[0].set_ylabel('Total suicides, in millions')
                      #should note the dataset goes 1990-2020 so 30 years worth.
                      
                      sns.barplot(x='Generation', y='DeathRatePer100K', 
                      data=suicide_rate, ax=ax[1],
                      edgecolor='black', errorbar=None
                                 )
                      ax[1].set_title('Suicide rates for each generation per 100k recorded deaths')
                      ax[1].set_ylabel('Number of suicides, per 100k deaths ')

''' Bar charts show the total suicides across each generation and suicide rates per generator in a 100k sample.'''
''' These indicate that, overall, generation x, followed by baby boomers have the highest amount of suicide. However, if you look at per 100k deaths, '''
''' it highlights that the silent generation, followed by baby boomers are more likely to commit suicide.'''

-----------------------------------------------
4) How does the employment population ratio correlate with suicide rates?

''' Weak to no relationship between Gross national, GDP, GDP per capita, GNI Per Capita as they sit around 0.
Or slightly above/below.
Two factors show a stronger relationship than other factors, however, weak in terms of correlation.
Inflation rate is around 0.05 suggesting, if at all, a weak relationship between higher inflation rates 
and suicide rates.
The strongest negative correlation comes ata Employment ratio vs Suicide Rates. Suggesting a weak relationship
between higher employment rates and lower suicide rates and it's converse. 

The direction of these correlations, while expected are too low to identify any relationship and therefore it
cannot be concluded that there are any strong or negative relationships between the factors listed below and
their effect on suicide rates.
